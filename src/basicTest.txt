next, need to actually create the lfn buffers and somehow pass them to the sfn shit.
to get the lfn, only reset the buffer when the next order has & 0x40
Then to get offset its the order * 13 as each lfn entry is 13 chars.
so when next seq = 0, its the entry and then reset the buffer.
then task 6 done.




--- TASK6 ---
- Add lfns as they appear.
- Remove after sfn handled
- calc checksum for lfns
- print the long file name
